  <p>This book is written by <em> Peter Thiel,Cofounder of Paypal</em>..This book is for the one who is interested in <mark>Startup,doing own Business,Entrepreneurship,</mark>etc....This is one of the best book on startup till today.<br><br>
  
<strong>Basically there are two type of Company</strong>...<br><br>
  
  
  1.The first one which creates new creative thing or technology or new segment( which are going from 0 to 1 ) ..
As they have totally new concept so they  are hard to imagine.These are the companies which goes on <em> vertical progress</em>..<br>

2.The second one which creates the new thing or tech by improving the existing tech(which is going from 1 to n).. As they are basically like modifications of existing tech so they are easy to imagine...These are the companies which goes on <em>horizontal progress</em>..<br> <br>
 
<strong>Some of  lesson that I have learn from this book are as follow:</strong><br><br>

1. It is easier to dominate a small market then a large market... Dominate on niche market & start small and monopolize so no one can notice..<br>

2.<em>War is costly business</em>.... Microsoft early segment was Operating System and Google was just a search engine....  But as the day pass both companies fight by entering their segment...<em>  Bing Vs  google search, office Vs Docs, explorer Vs Chrome...</em><br>

3.<em>All Happy Companies are different</em>:each one earn a monopoly by solving a unique problem.. All failed Companies are the same: they failed to escape competition...<br>

4.Choosing a cofounder is like getting married, and founder conflict is ugly as divorce.... 
Best way to choose a cofounder is to know his prehistory before starting the Company together....<br>

5.<em>Board of directors are bitch sometimes</em>... So try to add a minimum number of board members.... Try to limit board member seat by 3 or 5........<br>

6.You never know how big your Company may be in future... So don't try to quit early when your company is in losses...<br><br>
